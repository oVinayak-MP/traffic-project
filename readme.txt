  Reinforcement learning
The model learns to minimise the average waitng time for vehicles that enter the system until they leave the system.
The traffic signals are controlled to minimise the waiting time.Ie the system learns to control the traffic signals by analysing the traffic in the roads and their speed.
This uses SUMO for simulating the real world traffic.
